# Linear Regression
This algorithm Computes the linear regression of a data set
## Inputs:
1. x: x-values for our data set
2. y: y-values for our data 
## Outputs:
1. fX: x-values with outliers removed
2. fY: y-values with outliers removed
3. slope: slope from the linear regression y=mx+b
4. intercept: intercept from the linear regression y=mx+b
5. Rsquared: R^2, a.k.a. coefficient of determination
