# MECH_105_Algorithms
This repository will contain the algorithms that I did while in MECH 105 of my 2022 spring semester
The included Algorithms will be: 
* Creating a matrix to follow different rules
* Root finding using false position
* Gaussian elimination solving for upper and lower triangular matrices
* Simpsons 1/3 rule solving for an integral of a set of data
* Finding the linear regression line from a given set of data
For each of these you can read the README file for more information
