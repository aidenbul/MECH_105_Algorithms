# False Position
This algorithm estimates the root of a given function
## Inputs:
* func - the function being evaluated
* xl - the lower guess
* xu - the upper guess
* es - the desired relative error (defaults to 0.0001%)
* maxit - the maximum number of iterations to use (defaults to 200)
* varargin
## Outputs:
* root - the estimated root location
* fx - the function evaluated at the root location
* ea - the approximate relative error (%)
* iter - how many iterations were performed

(This algorithm is not completely finished)
